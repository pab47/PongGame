SPACESHIP HCF
==================================================================================

INCOMING MISSION BRIEFING:

Cadet 0xBADA55,

You have an important mission ahead of you. You're in charge of our main line
defense ship, Spaceship HCF. Your mission, defend the mothership as best you can.
An unknown assailant has launched a weapon at the mothership, and our shields
are down. You must use HCF's gravity well to pull the missile into your orbit
and launch it back at the enemy's ship. Our scientists estimate it will take
between 5 and 10 hits to fully destroy the enemy ship. However, because we
are vulnerable, our ship can only take one hit before we go down.

Your mission will not be easy, pilot. We have had the misfortune of being
attacked right as an asteroid has entered the pull of the combined ships' gravity.
Because HCF's gravity well only affects metal, this asteroid will just bounce around
our immediate vicinity. However, if it comes into contact with the missile they will
affect each other's trajectory.

Making matters worse, on the left hand side of our field, a worm hole has appeared
and is causing anything that enters it to emerge somewhere in the area. We have
no way of estimating where either the asteroid or missile will go when it enters
the worm hole, so be on your toes!

Good luck pilot,
General 0xDEADFALL 

==================================================================================
HOW TO PLAY
==================================================================================

Press the left and right arrow keys to control your spaceship. Because of the
gravity well in your ship, even if the missile gets behind your ship, you can still
pull the missile back into the game with your pull of gravity. Your gravity well
only affects metal objects, so the asteroid is unaffected

Additionally, if any object enters the wormhole on the left side of the screen,
they will be teleported randomly on the screen.

Hit the opponent's ship (opposite yours) enough times to win!

FAQS
=================================================================================

Q: Why is my ship equipped with a gravity well?
Q: Why are we even flying into asteroids next to a wormhole?
Q: What happens if I win?

A: It's just a game, you should really just relax
