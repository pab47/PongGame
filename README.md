Miniproject in Robotics class - MATLAB single player pong game

The students were given MATLAB code for a single player pong game that had basic visualization that included the game board, the paddle, the ball, and input from the screen to move the paddle but not programmed to detect the walls of the board or paddle. The students had to create two versions:
(1) Basic version: Complete the code to detect the walls and the paddle
(2) Advanced version: Add three features to the basic pong game (e.g., scoring, more balls, multiple levels, etc) to make the game more interesting to play.

A 7-minute video explaining what the students need to do is here: https://youtu.be/IGi68llXzyo

For project instructions see the file: pong_instructions.pdf
The incomplete version of the pong (given to the students): pong_basic_incomplete.m
The completed basic version of the pong game (use arrow keys left/right/bottom to move the paddle): pong_basic.m
The students submissions to the advanced version are in the folder: pong_project_submissions
